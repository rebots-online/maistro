## Model Training

The sheet music detection model uses YOLOv12, the latest state-of-the-art object detection model, and is trained on our custom dataset. YOLOv12 offers significant improvements over previous versions, including better accuracy for small objects like musical notation and faster inference speeds. To train the model:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Configure your Roboflow API key in `.env`

3. Train the model:
```bash
python model-training/scripts/train_model.py
```

The model is optimized for NVIDIA GPUs and uses:
- Mixed precision training (FP16)
- Image caching for faster training
- Multi-threaded data loading

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Roboflow
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- Other requirements in `requirements.txt`

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maistro.git
cd maistro
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

## Usage
1. Data Processing
```bash
python data-processing/preprocess_images.py
```

2. Model Training
```bash
python model-training/scripts/train.py
```
